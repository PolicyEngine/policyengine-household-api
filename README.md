# PolicyEngine Household API 

A version of the PolicyEngine API that runs the `calculate` endpoint over household object. To debug locally, run `make debug`. 

## Development rules

1. Every endpoint should return a JSON object with at least a "status" and "message" field.

Please note that we do not support branched operations at this time.

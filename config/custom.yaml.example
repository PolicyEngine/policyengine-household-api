# Example custom configuration file for mounting
# 
# This file shows the structure for a custom configuration that can be
# mounted into the container at runtime. Currently, all values are commented
# out as the application still uses environment variables.
#
# To use this file:
# 1. Copy it to your own location: cp custom.yaml.example my-config.yaml
# 2. Uncomment and modify the settings you want to override
# 3. Mount it when running the container:
#    docker run -v $(pwd)/my-config.yaml:/app/config/custom.yaml \
#               -e CONFIG_FILE=/app/config/custom.yaml \
#               policyengine/household-api
#
# IMPORTANT: Do not put secrets in this file. Use environment variables for sensitive data.
